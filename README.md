## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Core Functionality
- Full and differential backup modes
- Parallel execution of backup jobs (multi-threaded)
- Real-time progress per job in a dedicated UI
- File encryption based on extension

### 📂 File Priority System
- Set a list of prioritized file extensions (e.g., `.pdf`, `.docx`)
- Non-priority files wait until all priority files are backed up
- Priority list is ordered and respected during execution

### 🌐 Network Load Throttling
- Define a network usage threshold (KB/s)
- Automatically reduce the number of parallel jobs when network is overloaded

### 🧠 Smart Execution Controls
- Block execution if specified software (e.g., `discord.exe`) is running
- Pause, resume, and stop backups manually or remotely
- Large file handling using semaphores

### ⚙️ Settings and Configuration
- Fully configurable via the Settings UI
- All preferences stored in `config.ini` and JSON files:
  - Language (`en`, `fr`)
  - Log format (`json`, `xml`)
  - Priority extensions (with drag-and-drop ordering)
  - Blocked software
  - Network threshold & max jobs

### 🌍 Localization
- Multi-language support (English and French)
- All labels dynamically switchable in real time

### 🔧 Logging
- Logs saved in JSON or XML based on user preference
- Each file transfer is logged with duration, size, encryption info

### 📡 Remote Control
- Control the app via TCP client
- Supported commands: `pause`, `resume`, `stop`
